  <p>After thoroughly analysing the updated Burning glass data, we observed that our group’s ideal jobs remained the same. As first year university students, doing a bachelor of IT degree is helpful as it educates us in every general field of IT, which can help each individual member to seek out many fields they would like to pursue. Having an ideal job in your mind can motivate and help an individual to find information that is based on that job (For example, if your ideal job is a data scientist, you wouldn’t be that interested in programming). After learning about each area of IT, you may want to change your ideal job based on new information that you have gained, but most of the time it remains the same.</p>
