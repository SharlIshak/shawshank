We’re a proud and patriotic people with an indescribable love for our, beautiful, coastal Central Eastern European nation, with a rich history, a love for food, dance and many sports. We have word which encapsulates this strong connection, ‘neopisivo’. Whilst I admittedly am not well versed in the Croatian language, I nevertheless am proud of my ethnicity. I went to primary school at Holy Family Primary school and completed high school/VCE at St Josephs College in Geelong where I have lived for 12.5 years. I have a love for the sport of Football, I play at NPL3 U20s team North Sunshine Eagles as a Goalkeeper. I am by no means a naturally gifted player and have to work very hard to get any kind of reward out of the sport, I have a long way to go before I consider myself a good player, but I love it both as a player and an avid supporter regardless of my ability. </p></td>
