      <h2>GROUP REFLECTION</h2>
      <p>From the start, the group was very organised. The workload was distributed evenly amongst every group member, each having their own tasks due before our next meeting. The scheduled meetings we had were good but could be improved on as not all group members were present. The work was done before the due date, and the group had extra time to review everything before submitting. As mentioned before, our group meetings could be improved on as not all members were present. This could be done by sending out emails or reminders on canvas to ensure all members attended. A surprising thing we learnt as a group was how resilient we were despite the current pandemic going on and the lack of ability for us to arrange face-to-face meetings which are naturally easier to communicate in as opposed to meeting in Microsoft Teams. I think because of this pandemic there wasn’t room for complacency or slacking off, we were essentially forced to get our work done or fail and our group ending up overcoming the challenge of having to do online meetings in order to get the work done. One thing that we learnt as a group is how hard it is to pull off a group assignment despite the circumstances we are in. It is important when working in a group to let everyone have an input in the overall direction of the assignment, as a well organised group is the most important feature to ensure a successful submission. Every group needs a certain group leader, but in our group, each person had their own opinion and voiced their own input when it was suitable. For our next assignment, we will need to have a better use on GitHub, where it should be containing most of our activities and works. We should use GitHub more effectively next time as it is a useful platform with various amounts of codes and a great workspace for teamwork. We also used Canvas for most of our assignment work, such as using the Files to upload our activity logs for each of our meetings, and creating announcements to alert our members of the group, as the communication in our group was not the best. </p>
      <h4>STEVEN BALLAH</h4>
      <p>The group was organised to complete set tasks and overall equal contributions made throughout the whole of the assignment. The Meetings set over Microsoft Teams could have been improved if there was no pandemic, but due to such outbreak, we are forced to stay home and communicate online through online meetings. The one surprising thing was that everyone did work and result in completion of the assignment considering the outbreak, as a team we all managed to stay on task and complete the work assigned during the meetings. One thing that I have learned about groups is that having a positive attitude can be effective especially collaborating to complete work. Keeping a log of our activity was not done very efficiently on GitHub, as we have found an alternative to complete work on Microsoft SharePoint, as it is clearly visible live, thus being more engaging and effective to gather all the information to then put on the HTML site. Also due to a lack of experience using GitHub, it took some days trying to figure how to use, which we uploaded sample HTML site template previously made by Noel. We also used Canvas for most of our assignment work, such as using the Files to upload our activity logs for each of our meetings, and creating announcements to alert our members of the group, since members didn’t have any other means of communication, ie. social media. </p>
      <h4>SHARL ISHAK</h4>
      <p>The group meetings that we had scheduled went well, as almost every meeting we had every group member attend. The group got the work done in time, with a couple of days to check for everything to make sure nothing was missed. The group’s communication before the meetings was good but could be improved, as we would like everyone to attempt the meetings as much as they can. To improve it, we should try to email more or send out more reminders to make sure everyone is present. One thing that was surprising to me was the amount of work needed to pull off a group project. Each person must carry their weight and contribute to the team’s work. It surprised me how well our group worked together, considering the circumstances such as the pandemic, etc. Every group needs a certain group leader, but in our group, we started with a leader and individually built up enough courage so that everyone knew what to do on their own. In our group, no one knew what GitHub was or what it was used for before it was too late. Our log of activity was not on GitHub, but rather on Microsoft Teams, and for our group work, we used Microsoft SharePoint to submit all our work on a single document. Overall, the most important thing is to improve our communication next time. </p>
      <h4>KARL ZILIC</h4>
      <p>I think the group was really efficient with performing their designated tasks. All the work we set out for each person was done on time and to a good standard. Everyone was really well mannered towards one another in meetings and we allowed each other to freely express thoughts and opinions. One aspect that definitely needed work though was communication in regard to making sure everyone was at meetings and if we couldn’t make meetings, inform the group with time in advance. I myself was guilty of missing a meeting and not giving Steven or any of the other guys a heads up. That’s something I think some of us can work on. One thing that was surprising was that we all got our work done and this ties in with what I’ve learnt about groups which is they aren’t as difficult to co-ordinate as I previously thought. My efforts on the assignment didn’t at all match my GitHub logs as I gave my work to Steven and Noel to submit on my behalf. Perhaps in the future I should make more of an effort to understand how to use GitHub and submit my work within the code myself. </p>
      <h4>NOEL MATTHEWS</h4>
      <p>I thought our group was well organised from the beginning. We planned out meeting times to suit our timetables, and whilst I missed a couple, in general we had most members of our group involved each meeting. We delegated tasks evenly between everyone and each had a say in the direction of our assignment. I think our use of GitHub could be improved. Making a bigger effort to understand it and use its features may have made our assignment easier. I don’t think this impacted on the quality of our project in the end, however. I was surprised by how easily everyone in our group got along and managed their tasks. Often there may be a member of the group that does not pull their weight, but I think in our case everyone worked well together. It is important when working in a group to let everyone have an input in the overall direction of the assignment. A culmination of ideas results in a good finished product. </p>
      <h4>SUHAYB WALTON</h4>
      <p>I believe the group work that we all had was very well planned, everyone was first set tasks to complete and they we were. Even if me or others didn’t attend the meetings the work was still complete. The group had rich communication and that’s how we were able to get the work done. We used Microsoft teams to communicate and hold our group meetings and post anything related to the work. Something that myself and others can improve on would be attending the online meetings, I myself haven't attended some due to work. In the end, everyone was involved and we all contributed to the workload. </p>
      <h4>YAN JIAO SHEN</h4>
      <p>Our group has organized the tasks well and done the works on time.  We worked well as a team, everyone was helping each other and communicating effectively. We shared the information and sources regularly, so no one falls behind. We had a lot of meetings that allows us to check the schedule of the assignment. The online meetings though the Microsoft Teams can be improved as it is not effective as the real ‘face-to-face meetings’.  We should also use GitHub effectively as it is a useful platform for coding and developing. I was surprised that we can work well with only online meetings and communicating. As a team we delegated the tasks well and we finished the project together. We communicated well and all our meetings were on time. From the groupwork, I learned how to work with people that have different skills, everyone has the chance to do their areas of expertise, which saved a lot of time and energy. For GitHub, I think we can use it more effectively, as it is a great platform for writing codes together and teamwork.</p>
