      <h2>IT TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
      <h4><u>1. DATA SCIENCE</u></h4>
      <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>What does it do? </i></p>
      <p>Data scientists work with data to obtain information and derive insights for businesses. Tasks include capturing, maintaining, processing and communicating data. Most data scientists have training and education in programming, statistics, mathematics and data visualisation. Furthermore, they are also proficient in technologies like Apache Hadoop, GitHub, Tableau and MapReduce. In 2018, it was estimated that 80% of global data was unstructured, meaning that it is not modelled or organised and is often “text-heavy”. Data scientists extract value from large amounts of unstructured information and businesses use this newly organised information to make better decisions based on quantifiable evidence. Data can be used to compare historical trends and analyse competitors and the market. This can help businesses respond to market trends and promote their products or services in areas where they will sell best. Information gleaned from employment websites, social media and business databases is used to better manage employee recruitment. Companies use this data to sort applicants and ensure potential employees suit the organisation’s ethos. Whilst data science has already proven to be an invaluable resource for businesses, future developments are just as exciting. In 2019, improved technologies and refined methods of data science has led to its application in conservative and highly regulated fields like healthcare. In a challenge carried out by the reputable online data science community, Kaggle, teams were asked to develop a data science model to classify chest and lung issues. In conjunction with organisations in the field, data science was used to identify disease and culminated in US FDA clearance of the first articifical intelligence algorithms in X-Rays to automatically scan for disease instead of waiting for a radiologist to review. A further use in the healthcare field includes the identification of drug-supplemental interactions through Supp.ai developed by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). This website automatically extracts evidence of supplement and drug interactions for scientific literature and presents them to user. </p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What is the likely impact? </i></p>
      <p>Data science impacts across the healthcare industry will be large. Traditionally, health practitioners are well-trained technically, and possess empathy and balanced interpersonal skills. It has been suggested that an increased use of technology will de-humanise medicine as practitioner-patient relationships become remote monitoring of data, and short meetings via webcam. There would be no physical interaction required and a reduction in trust between patients and doctors. Further to this, decisions are taken out of the hands of qualified medical experts, are made based on hypothetical success outcomes of data driven therapy strategies. This change could lead to significant job losses across the field. On the positive side, data science in health will vastly improve treatment and decision making. Automation of simple tasks will allow practitioners more time to improve patient relationships, and allow for better decision making as automation ensures access to large amounts of data. As seen already in the afore-mentioned Kaggle challenge, data science would lead to earlier detection, improved tracking and understanding of disease. The physical and mental monitoring and maintenance will be made easier. These impacts are true across all industries, in that data science will have both positive and negative effects. </p>
      <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
      <p>The effect of data science at a personal level will be greatly felt across the globe. As discussed above, patients will see improved efficiency in their healthcare, as tests, results and treatments are quicker. Trips to the doctor’s office will be limited and there will be less face to face meetings as doctors rely on data from offsite to diagnose, thus enabling use of remote video facilities for patient contact. You may not know who your doctor actually is, which reduces trust and relationship building. As data is made more available to the general public, not only will practitioners have greater understanding, but patients will also have more sizeable knowledge about their own health issues and treatments. In a general sense, data science will improve quality of life. </p>
      <h4><u>2. CYBER-SECURITY</u></h4>
      <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>What does it do? </i></p>
      <p>Cybersecurity is the security of web associated frameworks, for example, equipment, programming and information from digital dangers. The training is utilized by people and ventures to secure against unapproved access to server farms and other mechanized frameworks. </p>
      <p>Here are some of the lists on the type of Cyber security threats: </p>
      <p>Ransomware is a kind of malevolent programming. It is intended to blackmail cash by blocking access to documents or the PC framework until the payoff is paid. Paying the payoff doesn't ensure that the records will be recuperated or the framework reestablished. Phishing is the act of sending deceitful messages that take after messages from trustworthy sources. The point is to take delicate information like Visa numbers and login data. It's the most widely recognized sort of digital assault. You can help secure yourself through training or an innovation arrangement that channels vindictive messages. Social engineering is a strategy that enemies use to fool you into uncovering delicate data. They can request a financial installment or access your secret information. Social building can be joined with any of the dangers recorded above to make you bound to tap on joins, download malware, or trust a malevolent source. </p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What is the likely impact? </i></p>
      <p>An absence of focus on cyber security can be extraordinarily harming to a business. There is the direct monetary expense of such assaults to the business, for example, robbery of corporate data, disturbance to exchanging or in any event, fixing influenced frameworks all subsequent in money related misfortune. Just as the physical effect, cyber security breaks can likewise cause reputational harm. With an absence of confidence in the security of the influenced business, clients will be increasingly disposed to wander somewhere else, bringing about lost deals and benefits. </p>
      <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
      <p>Advanced criminals utilize the web to take cash and data. Regardless of whether their weapons of decision incorporate sham email joins, online life con imaginativeness, or mind boggling infections that contaminate even the most protected frameworks, these virtual guilty parties do genuine harm in their casualties' lives. As indicated by web security pioneer, McAfee, cybercrimes cost the economy over $400 billion yearly. The objective of cyber security is to shield delicate computerized data from the individuals who might utilize it for evil reasons. While organizations need to take unique measures to guarantee the wellbeing of their advantages, everybody can profit by a far reaching digital security plan. </p>
      <p>Web Safety for the Average User: As indicated by CNN News, 47% of American grown-ups in 2014 had individual data fall under the control of programmers. Regardless of whether you don't maintain a business or have a great deal of monetary resources, your own data is significant to web criminals. Taken subtleties are utilized to submit an assortment of cheats that are intended to take your cash. Criminals can utilize your own data to make credit accounts that can take a very long time to clear up. Online networking con artists target forlorn singles, land trackers, and trade-in vehicle purchasers with counterfeit profiles and void guarantees. Email programmers take your interchanges with loved ones looking for data they can use to coerce cash. The web can be a risky spot, however discerning programs can find a way to diminish the odds of information breaks. Introduce a security program on the entirety of your gadgets. Set it to refresh and examine consequently. Ensure your program has a firewall. Audit your bank and financial records every month. Call the client support line on the off chance that you see any weird or strange charges. You can likewise pursue a credit observing help. These organizations will alarm you when an occasion influences your credit document. Change your passwords at any rate once at regular intervals. Arbitrary mixes of letters, numbers, and unique characters might be difficult to recall, yet they are additionally harder for programmers to find. Utilize a secret phrase program that spares and scrambles your logins to stay away from memory slips. Try not to acknowledge companion or message demands from individuals you don't know via web-based networking media. Hoodlums utilize counterfeit profiles to dig your record for pictures, areas, and other information they can use to take from you. Be cautious with email joins. Check the sender's location to ensure the message truly originates from the association it professes to speak to. Remember that most money related organizations don't send email connects or request delicate subtleties over the web. Little, normal advances can guard you from digital criminals. </p>
      <h4><u>3. MACHINE LEARNING</u></h4>
      <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>What does it do? </i></p>
      <p>AI calculations use measurements to discover designs in massive* measures of information. Furthermore, information, here, includes a great deal of things—numbers, words, pictures, clicks, what have you. In the event that it very well may be carefully put away, it tends to be taken care of into an AI calculation. AI is the procedure that powers a large number of the administrations we use today—proposal frameworks like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; web search tools like Google and Baidu; internet based life channels like Facebook and Twitter; voice collaborators like Siri and Alexa. The rundown goes on. In these cases, every stage is gathering however much information about you as could be expected—what sorts you like watching, what joins you are clicking, which statuses you are responding to—and utilizing AI to make an exceptionally instructed surmise about what you may need straightaway. Or on the other hand, on account of a voice colleague, about which words coordinate best with the amusing sounds coming out of your mouth. To be honest, this procedure is very essential: discover the example, apply the example. In any case, it basically runs the world. That is in large part because of an innovation in 1986, kindness of Geoffrey Hinton, today known as the dad of profound learning. </p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What is the likely impact? </i></p>
      <div id="Lists">
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
        <li>Climate change modelling: accurate modelling depends on the power to process a mess of variable inputs to reach a scenario. Machine learning can dramatically increase the speed and accuracy of climate models.</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles: machine learning is important to the event of truly intelligent cars which will make quick unprogrammed “decisions "based on "observed” data, and to making sure these cars function safely.</li>
        <li>Medical research: machine learning can finally help bridge the knowledge gap in medicine. it'll allow machines to analyse a plethora of patient data with much greater speed that humans are capable of and suggest diagnoses or treatment which will be overlooked by the physician.</li>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
        <li>Machines may surpass humans' highest level of intelligence to some extent where the psychologically manipulate people and become destructive to humans</li>
        <li>People may fail to completely align AI’s goals with the values of humanity, instead that specialize in emotionless optimisation processes, causing machines to form decisions that aren't within the best interest of humans</li>
        <li>Small or inadvertent errors or bias within the data, could also be magnified within the end of the day as machines train themselves on the faulty inputs, resulting in decisions not within the interest of all humans.</li>
        <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
        <p>Machines can store and access a larger number of information than any one individual could—including marvelous insights. Utilizing huge information, AI might one be able today distinguish patterns and utilize that data to show up at h answers for beforehand illogical issues. For instance, IBM's Green Horizon Project breaks down ecological information from a huge number of sensors and sources to item exact, developing climate and contamination estimates. It permits city organizers to run "imagine a scenario where" situations and model approaches to moderate ecological effect. Also, that is simply starting. Energizing condition situated developments are entering the market each day, from self-changing shrewd indoor regulators to disseminated vitality frameworks. Consider what percentage people have a checking account. Now, on top of that, consider the amount of credit cards that are in circulation. what percentage man hours wouldn't it deem employees to sift through the thousands of transactions that happen every day? By the time they noticed an anomaly, your checking account might be empty, or your MasterCard maxed out. Using location data and buy patterns, AI also can help banks and credit issuers identify fraudulent behavior while it's happening. These machines learning based anomaly detection models monitor transaction requests. they will spot patterns in your transactions and alert users to suspicious activities can even confirm with you that the acquisition was indeed yours before they process the payment. it's going to seem inconvenient if it had been just you eating at a restaurant while traveling on holiday, but it could find yourself saving you thousands of dollars someday. </p>
        <h4><u>4. AUGMENTED REALITY</u></h4>
        <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>What does it do? </i></p>
        <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a newer technical content that promotes the integration of real-world information and virtual world information content, which superimpose a computer-generated virtual world on the real world. The field of medical, education and industry has proven Augmented Reality as a tool relates to people’s daily life, has a far-reaching impact on humans’ society. It uses physical information that is difficult to experience in the real-world spatial range on the basis of computers and other scientific technologies to implement simulation. Processing and superimposing will effectively apply the virtual information content in the real world, and in this process can be perceived by human senses, so as to achieve a sensory experience beyond reality. After the real environment and the virtual object overlap, they can coexist in the same screen and space. Augmented reality technology can not only effectively reflect the content of the real world, but also can promote the display of virtual information content. These delicate contents complement and superimpose each other. In the visual augmented reality, users need to make the real world and computer graphics overlap together on the basis of their displays. After the overlap, you can fully see the real world surrounding it. Augmented reality technology mainly includes new technologies and means such as multimedia and three-dimensional modeling and scene fusion. There is a clear difference between the information content provided by augmented reality and the information content that humans can perceive. The current state of art Augmented Reality is focusing on mobile phones which is the only AR technology that is currently possible to enter the public and into everyone's life, the representative samples are ARCore from Android and ARKit from Apple. The current three major technical points for Augmented Reality is three-dimensional registration, virtual reality fusion display, and human-computer interaction. The process is to first collect the real scene data through the camera and sensor, and pass it to the processor to analyze and reconstruct it, and then update the data of the spatial position change in the real environment from the user in real time through the accessories, so as to obtain the relative position of the virtual scene and the real scene, realize the alignment of the coordinate system and perform the fusion calculation of the virtual scene and the real scene, and finally present the composite image to the user. Users can collect control signals through AR headsets or interactive accessories on smart mobile devices and perform corresponding human-computer interaction and information updates to achieve augmented reality Interactive operation. The development of Augmented Reality seems it has reached its bottleneck, AR has completed the technology precipitation stage that is popularized in people's lives and produces practical utility, but these technologies and existing results cannot be well integrated into our lives. It lacks some groundbreaking, hype and a representative major case to bring this new technology into your life. But there are still a lot that we can expect from this technology. AR Earphone is an attractive technology product that needs more developments, which will require the developments of the mobilized VR technology and the technical of AI systems and the upgrade of the perception function of the earphone. AR can become the most popular way to do shopping and it seems like it can be done in short future base on the mass popularization of mobile devices. The current difficulty for this technology is the limit of Smart mirror technology and how-to compatible AR in to physical stores. It can be done through the mass production of cost-effective AR devices and the develop of AR apps for mobile devices. </p>
        <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What is the likely impact? </i></p>
        <p>Currently, Augmented Reality is a technology that tries to ‘beyond reality’, It wraps the ‘enhanced’ virtual digital layer generated by these intelligent computer devices on to the real world, allowing you to see the world more ‘enhanced’ than before. Therefore, it is a technology benefiting everyone’s life. This technology is bringing huge impacts on lots of different areas, such as industry, medical, education, entertainment, services and software developments. It showed the new future development trends for software developers and hardware developers. It will create a lot of job opportunities because this technology is not mature yet, it still needs a lot of development on soft wares, such as designing apps based on augmented reality and hard wares such as AR glasses and earphones. Augmented reality also brings a direct impact on the development of artificial intelligence, which also bring a promote on its development. These technologies can compatible with each other, for example in the development of AR shopping, Consumers in the store can get AI-based customer support as they walk around. If they have questions about prices, features or current quotations, chatbots can provide answers based on natural language processing technology, and these feedbacks can also be customized according to each customer ’s unique profile to achieve a more powerful personalized service. Therefore, the development of Augmented Reality will also bring a lot of job opportunities for the area that links AR and AI. The development of Augmented Reality will also stimulate the development of VR through the development of software and hardware. If Augmented Reality technology is mature, it will replace the mobile devices and make display screens less necessary in daily life. </p>
        <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
        <p>Augment Reality will be a key character in short future, it will mass popularisation when the technology is mature. As it is a widely used technology, such as military, sales, entertainment, education, media, tourism and medical cares. AR has injected new vitality into the development of children's educational products with its rich interactivity. Children are characterized by liveliness and activity. Educational products developed using AR technology are more suitable for children's physical and psychological characteristics. For example, AR books that are everywhere on the market today are too abstract for young children. AR technology has also been increasingly used in medical education, patient analysis and clinical treatment in these years. Minimally invasive surgery has increasingly used AR technology to alleviate the pain of patients and reduce the cost and risk of surgery. In addition, in the medical teaching, the application of AR technology makes the esoteric medical theory become three-dimensional and easy to understand, which greatly improves the teaching efficiency and quality. AR technology can also help consumers more intuitively judge whether a product is suitable for themselves when shopping, so as to make more satisfactory choices. In the museum's introduction of exhibits, AR technology is also widely used, as it provides visitors with a guided introduction of exhibits by superimposing virtual text, pictures, videos and other information on the exhibits. In addition, AR technology can also be applied to the restoration and display of cultural relics, that is, the restoration part and the remaining part are perfectly combined through the AR technology on the original site or the missing cultural relics, so that the visitors can understand the original appearance of the cultural relics and achieve the immersive effect. Overall, this is a technology that can bring a lot of convenience to our lives in future. </p>
        <h4><u>5. HYPER AUTOMATION</u></h4>
        <p style="color: #80DEFF"><i>What does it do? </i></p>
        <p>Hyper-automation is the combination of aspects such as intelligence, packaged software and automated tools. It is the combination of “automat[ed] technologies and artificial intelligence” to achieve the completion of task which were previously handled by man (Leapwork, 2020). This idea of expanding systems via the use of automation and AI is to perform tasks and fulfill objectives in a more efficient, quick and smooth process. Common place examples of hyper-automation in our daily lives are help desks and credit card applications. In both examples, the artificial intelligence in has been taught to understand the information which is relevant to leading to an outcome. In the case of the help desk, the computers in place are programmed to deal with incoming phone calls and can potentially provide a solution for a customer/client by having basic responses programmed into the AI. A customer may flag that they’re unhappy with a product they want to return a product, the AI can through a database or by means of code can direct the consumer to a solution delivering a pre-set response with instructions or may direct the consumer straight to an actual person if the matter was a more complex issue. In regards to the example of a credit card application, AI implemented to filter through them are now capable of collating all the necessary information such as credit reports and background information to decide whether an applicant is trustworthy enough to be sent a credit card. Hyper-Automation does not just stop at a maximising efficiency in simplistic tasks but also can be seen in large scale factories through the use of Robotic Process Automation. Many factories around the world now utilise robots of sorts which are programmed by humans to perform parts of an assembly line in order to fully construct machinery such as cars, laptops, phones and many other integral pieces of modern technology. </p>
        <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What is the likely impact? </i></p>
        <p>The expansion of automation will inevitably put people out of work who previously performed the tasks which are now being occupied and carried out by AI technology and systems. However, the creation of the equipment and technology required to carry these tasks out has and will continue to also bring forth new employment opportunities which previously never existed. These new jobs required a high skill level as many of the programming and engineering of these products and systems need many years of tertiary education and previous experience within the fields of IT and engineering before a potential employee can be accepted into working within the field of Automated Technologies. For many businesses this will save large sums of funds which were previously allocated towards paying employees. These funds can now be redirected towards upkeep of machinery, in one example which I came across according to bernardmarr.com “a large… bank used 85 software bots to run 13 processes that handled 1.5 million requests in a year. … equalled 230 full-time employees… 30 per cent the cost of recruiting more staff.” (Bernard Marr, 2019). This one example is just one of many which can be seen across the world as more companies whether they be financially, computing or machine based this technology is here to stay and develop. Employment opportunities will rise for high skilled workers and corporations and business small or large will benefit financially but it may come at the cost of removing many thousands and potentially millions of jobs which previously existed.</p>
        <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">How will this affect you?</i></p>
        <p>In my own daily life, I will see and hear fewer human voices. At the moment I go to the shops and I use the self-service checkout, I pull cash out from an ATM, I order my lunch via a mobile application and if I want assistance regarding an issue with some software or a product the chances are I will be led to an FAQ website or hear a speech to text robot guiding me along the way to my desired solution. Those are examples of hyper-automation which are already in place. The expansion of hyper-automation is an inevitably of humans seeking to maximise the efficiency of tasks. At this current point in my life it mostly serves me positively and helps me to also maximise speed and efficiency of simple tasks on a daily basis. But I can’t help but feel the majority of jobs in the future will be replaced by robots programmed to power through tasks I can only a 1/10th or 1/100th of the speed. I have no doubt in my lifetime I will have family members and friends who work in factories or in IT for example who will replaced as a result of automation. It ultimately intends to serve us well, but potentially at the risk of losing human connection and interactions which previously were commonplace like talking to a cashier or hearing the voice of a help desk worker. </p>
