      <h2>IT WORK</h2>
      <p>Interview an IT Professional - Josip Zilic</p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</i></p>
      <p>I work as an IT delivery governance lead. My role is to identify key risks and issues that threaten the success of IT projects for Telstra’s enterprise customers. Through analysis of data that comes out of internal systems that project professional to track their key measurables, I use that data to help me identify where the patterns or trends are occurring in a positive or negative manner, upon id of negative trend, directs me to dive deeper into the reasons behind the trend, collaborating with the project professionals, steer to a remediation plan, to guide their projects back to good health or connect them to lines of business within Telstra which can concurrently result in escalation towards directors of business units. This helps maintain healthy relationships between Telstra and its enterprise customers. </p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</i></p>
      <p>IT professionals related to Telstra only. Enterprise solutions architects, software and hardware engineering specialists, architecture design specialists, specialists from security and mobility, managed networks, hardware and vendor specialists as well. Aligned with that are project managers, program managers and heads of departments. </p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </i></p>
      <p>Exclusively office bound and can work remotely. A typical working week for me consists of going into the office on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, I usually work 9 to 5 and I’ll walk in a pick a workstation on my designated floor, I then may attend face-to-face meetings in a meeting room or attend meetings via Microsoft Teams at my workstation. Wednesday’s and Friday’s, I usually work from home and will attend meeting online via Microsoft Teams.</p>
      <p><i style="color: #80DEFF">What aspect of their position is most challenging?</i></p>
      <p>I have multiple aspects of my job that I find challenging and keep me and everyone else on their toes. One challenge is gathering, reliable timely data from the range of sources available i.e., system tools data to indicate program progression or reporting by program teams that is required for customer consumption. Due to the size of Telstra I deal with a range of professionals that are spread across the country and internationally, and it is crucial that we align our cadences to be across the same objectives and to present to customers as well as internal teams in a timely fashion. I would say ensuring that vendors/3rd parties are aligned to our service levels and customer objectives is also a challenge. As you can tell communication is key in my line of work and a lot of challenges can arise from miscommunication or not having everyone on the same wavelength. </p>
